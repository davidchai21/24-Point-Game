This project was built many years ago. It was written in C# and used Microsoft Access as the database.

The content is a game called "24 Point" which gives you 4 integers ranging from 1 to 13(can have duplicates). You can use +,-,*,/ and parenthesis as well as changing the order of the 4 numbers to make the equation value to 24. All the 4 numbers must be used and can only be used once.

The result is guaranteed to have at least one solution since there is a solution checker inside, by which the system can check the result of the 4 randomly-generated numbers to see if there is possibility to get 24.

The reason to choose Access is because it's written in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 under the .Net Framework 3.5(Later changed to 4.0), and Access is more convenient to use on Windows.(Of course, other light DBMS can also be used like SQLite, etc.)

I have also built a setup file for you to install on your computer. It may require the package of .Net Framework. You can follow the instructions to install the related files from Microsoft website.

Have fun :)
